### This is post is associated with a workshop that was held on the 24th Feb 2022

**Workshop description** Mitch walked through the basics of raster analysis using R. In particular, he focused on the relatively new [Terra](https://github.com/rspatial/terra) package, which is set to replace the extremely popular [Raster](https://github.com/rspatial/raster) package. A basic understanding of R will help, but the workshop will be aimed at beginners with no prior knowledge.

## What we will cover:

1.  Raster and vector basics
2.  Introducing the Terra package
3.  Creating, Importing and exporting rasters
4.  Dealing with coordinate reference systems
5.  Naming and sub-setting SpatRaster layers
6.  Raster summaries
7.  Raster data manipulation
8.  Compatibility between Raster and Terra
9.  Options to allow the processing of large files
10. A real world example with drone data
11. A fun new package called Layer

You will need installations of R, RStudio and Terra.

## 1. Raster and vector basics

**Rasters** divide areas into a grid of rectangles of equal size. Each rectangle holds one or more value for a variable of interest.

**Vectors** consist of a series of coordinates that make points, lines or polygons.

## 2. Introducing the Terra package

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rspatial/terra/master/man/figures/logo.png" width="250"/>

Terra is set to replace the extremely popular Raster package. It is written by the same group of developers at [r spatial](https://github.com/rspatial), led by Robert Hijmans. This means that Terra is compatible with Raster - with some serious advantages.

**Advantages** of Terra over Raster. It's faster - unlike `Raster`, `Terra` is mostly written in C++, making it much faster for many operations.

It's simpler - `Terra` does away with the complex data structure of `Raster` like `RasterLayer`, `RasterStack` and `RasterBrick`. We will go into this later.

For now, lets install and load Terra.

```{r, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(terra)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("terra")
library(terra)
```

## 3. Creating, Importing and exporting rasters

The following examples are largely based on examples from the official [manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/index.html)

The `rast()` function is used to create and import `SpatRasters`.

To create a SpatRaster from scratch:

```{r echo=TRUE, message=TRUE}
x <- rast(nrows=108, ncols=108, xmin=0, xmax=10, ymin = 0, ymax = 10)
values(x) <- 1:ncell(x)
```

And, probably more useful, to import a raster from a file:

```{r, rastread}
f <- system.file("ex/meuse.tif", package="terra") #example data within terra
r <- rast(f)
```

But instead of `system.file()` (which is looking inside the `terra` package), point directly to a raster file.

```{r, plot}
plot(r)
```

To write a `SpatRaster` to file, we can use the the `writeRaster` function:

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
x <- writeRaster(r, "output.tif", overwrite=TRUE)
x
```

## 4. Dealing with coordinate reference systems

Getting the coordinate reference systems correct is a very important, and sometimes tricky, aspect of geospatial analysis.

There are two main classes of coordinate reference systems, have a look [here](https://rspatial.org/terra/spatial/6-crs.html) for a pretty good.

Angular coordinate reference systems - these represent the vertical and horizontal angles between the point on the surface and the center of the earth (see figure).

![](https://rspatial.org/terra/_images/sphere.png) Image reference: https://rspatial.org/terra/

To get location using an angular CRS, we require a pair of coordinates and a reference datum; a model of the shape of the earth. WGS84 is probably the most widely used global datum, where GDA94 / 2020 are commonly used Australian datums.

Projected coordinate reference system - here, angular coordinates have been converted to a Cartesian system, making it is easier to make maps and calculate area etc. These require a projection, a datum and a set of parameters. Projections include Mercator, UTM and Lambert.

**Defining a CRS in Terra**

Terra recommends using the EPSG database, as PROJ.4 is no longer fully supported.

To look up an EPSG code, go to https://epsg.org/ and find your CRS.

When you know the EPSG code associated with your data, you can assign it:

```{r assigncrs}
crs(x) <- "EPSG:27561" 
```

Be careful, this defines the CRS but doesn't change the underlying data. It is not generally recommended that you project raster data because it results in a loss of precision.

## 5. Naming and subsetting SpatRaster layers

Naming the layers of a SpatRaster is pretty straightforward, using the `names()` function.

```{r name}
s <- rast(system.file("ex/logo.tif", package="terra"))
names(s)
names(s) <- c("a", "b", "c")
names(s)
```

Sub-setting the layers of a `SpatRaster` is also a pretty simple operation.

You can either use square bracket notation `[]`, the `subset()` function, or `$` notation.

From the [manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/terra.pdf), here is an example using the R logo:

```{r subset, eval=FALSE}
subset(s, 2:3) #will select band 2 and 3
#because we changed the names from red, green, blue to a, b c. 
s[[c("a", "b")]] #will also select band 2 and 3
s$a #will select the a (red) band
```

Note that unlike with Raster, there is no need for different classes like Raster stacks/layers/bricks.

## 6. Raster summaries

Now that we know how to import a Raster, define its CRS, and select the bands we are interested in, its a good time to start investigating its values.

The `global()` function can be used to extract values like the average, mean and max cell values. Using the elevation data we imported earlier, we could work out the highest cell on the map with:

```{r global }
max_h <- global(r, "max", na.rm=TRUE)
max_h
```

The humble histogram is another useful tool when getting a handle on raster data. Terra allows you to create a frequency distribution histogram with `hist()`:

```{r hist}
hist(r)
```

Or if a boxplot is more your style, you can use `boxplot()`:

```{r boxplot}
boxplot(r)
```

## 7. Raster data manipulation

There are a huge number of functions within Terra for data manipulation, but here are a few that might be useful. \### Extend and trim Often, we will find a lot of white space consisting of NA's around our Raster. To remove this, we can use the `trim()` function. Conversely, to add white space to a raster (say, to match the extent of another Raster), we can run the `extend()` function.

To demonstrate this functionality, we will first add a lot of white space to our elevation raster using `extend`, before removing it with `trim`.

```{r trim1, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
extended <- extend(r, 50)
trimmed <- trim(extended)
```

### Aggregate and Resample

These are used to change the resolution of a `SpatRaster`.

Aggregate creates a new `SpatRaster` with a lower resolution. Users need to provide the factor by which the raster will be reduced.

```{r aggregate}
agg <- aggregate(r, fact = 5, fun = 'mean')
plot(agg)
```

You can see that the resolution has been reduced, by a factor of five in this case.

In reality, we will often need to combine rasters from different sources that have different origins and resolutions; this will require us to match the resolution, the origin and the extent. For this, the resample function is the way to go. To demonstrate this, we can first change the origin of the raster we just aggregated.

```{r aggregate2}
origin(agg) <- c(10.5, 10.5)
```

Then we can resample the original raster, `r`, using the new `agg` raster with different resolution and origin.

```{r resample}
rsm <- resample(r, agg, method= 'bilinear')
```

### Crop

Cropping is one of the most widely used operations when working with Raster data. To demonstrate a simple crop, we will need to use a `SpatVector`: the other major data class used by Terra.

On the data set we have been working on, we will first use the `spatSample()` function, another handy tool.

Here, we will randomly generate one point on the elevation raster.

```{r sample, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE }
samp <- spatSample(r, 1, as.points=TRUE, na.rm=TRUE)
```

Now we can make a buffer centered on this point using the `buffer()` function.

```{r makebuffer, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
buf <- buffer(samp, width = 200)
plot(r)
plot(samp, add=TRUE)
plot(buf, add=TRUE)
```

![](images/crop_example1.PNG)

Now we can crop the elevation raster to the buffered area.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE }
cropped <- crop(r, buf)
plot(cropped)
```

![](images/crop_example_2.PNG)

### Mask

Notice that the buffer was a circle, but the cropped area is square. Why? Because the crop command uses the extent of the object which is always a rectangle. If you wanted to maintain the shape of the buffer, you will want to use `mask()`

```{r mask, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
mask <- mask(r, buf)
mask <- trim(mask) #we can trim down all the NA values using the trim function
plot(mask)
```

![](images/maskandtrim.PNG)

### Stretch

Another task is to stretch values to a given range. For example, classification can require data that is normalised to 8bit (0-255). This can be handy if you want to normalise rasters on different scales, such as elevation in m AGL and reflectance in DN.

In terra, this is as easy as:

```{r stretch}
str <- stretch(r) #defaults to 0-255
global(str, "range", na.rm=TRUE)
```

### Focal

The `focal()` function can be used to clean and smooth rasters. `Focal()` uses a moving window with size `w` and a function to average neighboring cells. Lets do that with the elevation dataset:

```{r }
f <- focal(r, w=5, fun="mean")
plot(f)
```

## 8. Compatibility between Raster and Terra

If you have grow acustomed to using `Raster`, don't worry, it is not difficult switch between Raster classes (RasterLayer, RasterStack etc) and SpatRaster using the `rast()` function.

Here is an example.

First install the Raster packages, which is available on CRAN.

```{r installraster, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("raster")
library(raster)
```

Now, using the sample data loaded into Raster, we can create a Raster stack of the r logo.

```{r rasterstack, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
stac <- stack(system.file("ex/logo.tif", package="terra")) #This is a raster stack
rst <- rast(stac) #now this is a SpatRaster
```

Its that simple. And to change this back to a `Raster` object:

```{r rasterstack2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
stac <- raster(rst) #now this is a RasterStack
```

## 9. Options to allow the processing of large files

Terra has some settable options that can help to improve performance. Have a look through them with `?terraOptions`

Particularly useful options include `tempdir`, which provides a default location for files to be written. This can help prevent your C drive being clogged with temp files.

Also handy is `memfrac`, which lets us stipulate how much RAM `terra` is can use - from 0-0.9.

Check the current options with `terraOptions()`

Set options using `terraOptions(memfrac=0.2, tempdir = "C:/temp/terrafiles")`.

## 10. A real world example with drone data

In this example, we will use some of my drone data collected from savanna woodlands in north Australia.This is a typical example where we have an orthomosaic, which was derived from a camera (RGB), and a canopy height model, which was derived from LiDAR point cloud.

First, we need to reduce the size of the orthomosaic (1.3+ GB is too big). But in reality, we might want that much resolution depending on what we are trying to do.

You don't need to run the below code, but this is what I did to reduce down the large orthomosaic.

```{r preclean, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
orthopath <- ".../hacky_sac/2022-02-23 Basic raster analysis with R/plot1_ortho.tif"
ortho_reduced_path <- "...2022-02-23 Basic raster analysis with R/plot1_ortho_reduced.tif"
ortho <- rast(orthopath)
res(ortho) #check the resolution 

#now lets reduce it down with aggregate 

#note the filename variable lets us write directly to file
aggregate(ortho, fact = 10, fun = 'mean', filename = ortho_reduced_path)
ortho_reduced <- rast(ortho_reduced_path)
res(ortho_reduced)
```

Download the reduced orthomosaic [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k0xW1VQS3QE41hm200vJUC2SbMbf6RGs/view?usp=sharing)

And the chm [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qoKeXKwTy0ohMQZWfweW4TAj4WV22g05/view?usp=sharing)

The first thing to do is load the .tifs as `SpatRasters` in R.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
homefolder <- "..../Downloads" #where did you download the files to?
chm_path <- paste0(homefolder, "/", "plot1_chm.tif")
ortho_path <- paste0(homefolder, "/", "plot1_ortho_reduced.tif")

#now read in the files using terra
chm <- rast(chm_path)
ortho <- rast(ortho_path)
```

This is an example of needing to merge rasters with different geometries into a single raster. Before we can do this, we need to make sure the crs, resolution, origin and extent match.

```{r match_attr, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#do the crs match?
crs(chm) == crs(ortho)
#do the origins match?
origin(chm) == origin(ortho)
#do the resolutions match?
res(chm) == res(ortho)
#do the extents match?
ext(chm) == ext(ortho)
```

We should see that the CRS matches, but nothing else.

The `resample()` function can match the geometries. If we wanted to keep the higher resolution of the orthomosaic, we can run:

```{r resample2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
chm_resampled <- resample(chm, ortho, method = "bilinear")
#now, geometry should match
res(chm_resampled) == res(ortho)
origin(chm_resampled) == origin(ortho)
ext(chm_resampled) == ext(ortho)
```

On the right track. lets plot them to have a look.

```{r plot1, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
plot(chm_resampled)
```

![](images/chm_nottrimmed.PNG)

```{r plot2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
plot(ortho)
```

![](images/ortho_notcropped.PNG)

We can see that even though they have the same extent - as enforced by the `resample()` - there are a lot of blank cells around the CHM.

Lets get rid of those blank (NA) cells using the `trim()` function.

```{r trim2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
chm_resampled <- trim(chm_resampled)
plot(chm_resampled)
```

![](images/chm_resampled.PNG)

That's better, now lets crop the orthomosaic using the CHM.

```{r crop2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
ortho_cropped <- crop(ortho, chm_resampled)
```

Now everything should match, and we can finally combine these layers into a single `SpatRaster` object. For this, you can simply concatenate the layers: c(layer1, layer2, layer3).

```{r combine, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
combined <- c(ortho_cropped, chm_resampled)
plot(combined)
```

![](images/combined_1.PNG)

The band names don't make a lot of sense at this point, so we can rename them using the `names()` function.

```{r rename2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
names(combined) <- c('red', 'green', 'blue', 'chm')
```

Finally, prior to doing some analysis, we might want to stretch the chm to 8bit - so its not under-weighted compared to the RGB data. This calls for the `stretch()` function.

```{r stretch2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
combined$chm <- stretch(combined$chm)
plot(combined)
```

![](images/combined_final.PNG)

Now we have a raster stack we can work with!

## 11. A fun new package called Layer

One fun little package I stumbled on recently is called [`layer`](https://github.com/cran/layer). It doesn't really serve a purpose in terms of analysis, although I'll use it to make figures that demonstrate the raster data-sets used in analysis.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cran/layer/8af3637e9b6dbe0b936dbac0318797991a4e9371/man/figures/logo.svg" width="250"/>

Unfortunately, `Layer` calls for `Raster` data, but as we know, it's easy to convert `Raster` to `SpatRaster` objects.

But before we get into that, lets further reduce the resolution of the `combined` `SpatRaster`, as there is a lot going on in the background of `Layer` and its pretty slow.

```{r layerprep, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
combined_lowres <- aggregate(combined, fact = 10) #10x less rows and columns
```

Now we can load the `layer` and `raster` packages:

```{r load_raster_and_layer, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("layer")
library(layer)
```

Now we can provide the layers to `tilt_map`, then `plot_tilted_map`, to create a nice looking tilted stack that illustrates our data. Note within the `tilt_map` function, we convert the `SpatRaster` to `Raster` with the `raster()` function.

```{r layer, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
tilt_map_1 <- tilt_map(raster(combined_lowres$red))
tilt_map_2 <- tilt_map(raster(combined_lowres$green), x_shift = 0, y_shift = 50)
tilt_map_3 <- tilt_map(raster(combined_lowres$blue), x_shift = 0, y_shift = 100)
tilt_map_4 <- tilt_map(raster(combined_lowres$chm), x_shift = 0, y_shift = 150)

map_list <- list(tilt_map_1, tilt_map_2, tilt_map_3, tilt_map_4)

plot_tiltedmaps(map_list, 
                layer = c("value", "value", "value", "value"),
                palette = c("bilbao", "mako", "rocket", "turbo"),
                color = "grey40")
```
