# Geospatial Community April Newsletter

## Next workshop -- Friday April 21st, 1-3pm

### Raster and Spatial Random Forest with Dr Jacinta Holloway-Brown

Dr Jacinta Holloway-Brown will be providing a workshop on using the Stochastic spatial random forest [SS-RF](https://github.com/thejholloway/SS-RF_tutorial) method for filling missing data in satellite images due to clouds, and also going over using [raster2data](https://github.com/thejholloway/raster2data) for working with spatial image files (such as rasters), and converting these to dataframes in R in order to perform statistical analyses.

## Previous workshop

In March Dr Christina Buelow gave an awesome overview of the basics of analysing spatial data in R. You can find the full details of the workshop [here](https://brisbane-geocommunity.netlify.app/posts/2023-03-23-r-spatial-basics/), and keep an eye out for the recording on our YouTube channel (it will be linked on our website when it's up and running).
