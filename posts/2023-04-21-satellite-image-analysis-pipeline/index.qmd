[Dr Jacinta Holloway-Brown](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/jacinta.holloway-brown) will be providing a workshop discussing the satellite image analysis pipeline from start to finish with examples. Steps covered will be:

-   How to search for and download free satellite images from US Geological Survey [Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/)

-   How to convert a satellite image to a data frame. Includes how to calculate a vegetation index and derive land cover classes in R. Tutorial: [raster2data](https://github.com/thejholloway/raster2data)

-   How to fit a spatial random forest to satellite image data. This will include a brief overview of decision trees, random forest and stochastic spatial random forest methods. Code to fit spatial random forest will be provided and shared with the group.

-   How to fit stochastic spatial random forest [SS-RF](https://github.com/thejholloway/SS-RF_tutorial) to get predictions of land cover for missing observations with associated probabilities.

Fill out the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXfv6EPzm6ur5e9IrDPK07e5N1y2xxYNQlBe_xutTDu-ajBw/viewform) (see ⬆️) to get the invitation for the workshop.
