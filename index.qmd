Welcome to the **Geospatial Community**! Geospatial analysis can be difficult and intimidating, particularly when we don't have a strong background in coding, GIS or remote sensing.

The Geospatial Community tries to make this process a bit less painful, by sharing our experiences, skills and tricks in a friendly and inclusive environment.

We run monthly skill sharing tutorial sessions where a member of our community teaches us something they have learned along the way.

This usually occurs on the last Thursday of each month. See our [upcoming events](https://geospatial-community.netlify.app/upcoming-events/).
