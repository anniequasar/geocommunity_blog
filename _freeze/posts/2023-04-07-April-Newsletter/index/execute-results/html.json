You can find the full details of the workshop [here](https://brisbane-geocommunity.netlify.app/posts/2023-03-23-r-spatial-basics/), and keep an eye out for the recording on our YouTube channel (it will be linked on our website when it's up and running).\n\n## Training\n\n### UQ Library Training\n\n[**QGIS: Custom Maps on your Phone**](https://studenthub.uq.edu.au/students/events/detail/4472959) - Tuesday 11th April 2023, 9:30-11:30am\n\n[**QGIS: Vector Analysis**](https://studenthub.uq.edu.au/students/events/detail/4472960) - Tuesday 18th April 2023, 9:30-11:30am\n\n[**UQ R Usergroup (UQRUG)**](https://uqrug.netlify.app/) - Wednesday 26th April 2023, 12-2pm\n\n### Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Testing Casual Hypotheses in R\n\nFind more details and registration [here](https://www.amsa2023.amsa.asn.au/workshop).\\\n**Date:** July 2nd 2023\\\n**Time:** 9:00-16:00\\\n**Location**: Griffith University Gold Coast Campus, Building/Room G14_1.13B\\\n**Cost**: \\$30.\n\n**Note** This isn't a spatial workshop, but if you're interested in statistical analysis and R programming, this will be a good one. Spots are limited so please only register if you are sure you can make it.\n",
